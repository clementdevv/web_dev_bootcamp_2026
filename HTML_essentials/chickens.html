        The <b>chicken</b> (<i>Gallus gallus domesticus</i>) is a domesticated subspecies
        of the red junglefowl (<i>Gallus gallus</i>), originally native to Southeast Asia.
        Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round, 
        the legs are unfeathered in most breeds, and the wings are short.[20] 
        Wild junglefowl can fly, whereas domestic chickens and their flight muscles 
        are too heavy to allow them to fly more than a short distance.[21] Size and 
        coloration vary widely between breeds.[20] Newly hatched chicks of both modern 
        and heritage varieties weigh the same, about 37 g (1.3 oz). 
        Modern varieties however grow much faster; by day 35 a Ross 708 broiler 
        may weigh 1.8 kg (4.0 lb) as against the 1.05 kg (2.3 lb) of a heritage chicken of the same age.

        It was first domesticated around 8,000 years ago and ]is one of the most common
        and widespread domesticated animals in the world.
        As of 2023, the global chicken population exceeds 26.5 billion, 
        with more than 50 billion birds produced annually for consumption. 
        Specialized breeds such as broilers and laying hens have been developed for meat
        and egg production, respectively. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs per year.
        Chickens are social animals with complex vocalizations and behaviors, 
        and feature in folklore, religion, and literature across many societies. 
        Their economic importance makes them a central component of global animal husbandry.
